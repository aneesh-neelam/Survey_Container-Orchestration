Abstract
--------

Data center administrators and site reliability engineers create virtual machines or containers to run their applications, with desired redundancy requirements and automated coordination between the replicas.
This is called the orchestration of the various computing, storage and network resources of the data center.
To automate the orchestration process, different tools have been developed in the past couple of decades.
Each tool was designed differently, with different intents and priorities but they also have a lot in common.
This survey is on the various orchestration tools available to data center administrators, site reliability engineers and software engineers;
and aims to be a comprehensive guide that helps data center managers in choosing the cloud platform and the orchestration tool.
